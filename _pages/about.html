My research interests cover abstract frame theory, time-frequency analysis for audio signal processing, and deep learning.</p> <p>In my current project “Frame theory meets neural networks”, I develop frame-theoretic approaches to study the invertibility and stability of neural networks and propose architecture designs and regularizers to guarantee stable invertibility.</p> <p>If you are interested in the topic, I will be happy if you drop me a line 🤙</p> <p style="text-align: right;"> &lt;a href=mailto:daniel.haider@oeaw.ac.at&gt;daniel.haider@oeaw.ac.at&lt;/a&gt; </p> </body></html>
