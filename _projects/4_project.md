GRUBER makes scaffold constructions, high-performance tuning for motorcycle racing, sauna landscapes, and architecture plans. And GRUBER is also a band. Composing unobtrusive weirdness into moving pictures and a catchy song, GRUBER has always and never been wrong. GRUBER is a slow train ride and a little snooze, where you wake up relaxed, and slightly mused.
