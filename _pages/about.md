I am a PhD student in mathematics, working at the Acoustics Research Institute in Vienna. My research interests cover abstract frame theory, time-frequency analysis for audio signal processing, and deep learning.

In my current project "Frame theory meets neural networks", I develop frame-theoretic approaches to study the invertibility and stability of neural networks and propose architecture designs and regularizers to guarantee stable invertibility.

If you are interested in the topic, I will be happy if you drop me a line &#129305;
